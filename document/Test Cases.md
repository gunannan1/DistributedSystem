#Test Cases Design

### Requirements

#### Server auth

- All servers share the same secret in the sysstem

- Only server sends the secret generated by the very first server can connect to the system successfully

#### Register
- Validate message
- Check if user exists locally
    - YES: send register failed msg and return false
    - NO:  check if username under register process( in the register list 
        - YES: send register failed msg and return false
        - NO: check if any remote servers exists
  				YES: broadcastToAll
  				NO: register succ

####  Login 

Login logic from Aaron

- Validate message

- if the user the gives no username on the command line arguments then login as anonymous on start

- if the user gives only a username but no secret then first register the user, by generating a new secret (print to screen for subsequent use), then login after/if receiving register success

- if the user gives a username and secret then login on start

- Login info in other servers: Design by ourselves: Enquiry with other servers if no user info exists locally
We need deal with it: https://app.lms.unimelb.edu.au/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_364937_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_729820_1&forum_id=_401176_1&message_id=_1697906_1

- Login failed message should be sent from server ad received by client if failed

#### Logout

- Send logout message to server

- Close connection immediately 


#### Client Load Broadcast

- every 5 seconds, every server broadcasts the loads of clients to the system 

#### Redirection

- Any one contains at least 2 clients less than itself, redirect client connection to that server

- After client received a redirection message, connect to given server automatically

#### Activity

- Clients send activities

- Servers do activities before broadcasting activities(exclude the one who sends) when recieved from other servers or clients

- Clients do activities when received activity message
